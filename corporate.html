      <h4 class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Our brand's main goal is to shine a light onto the true authenticity of each human individual, because we value diversity and uniqueness. We strive towards a more sustainable and inclusive environment which is why our products are 110% cruelty free, in fact, our company donates to multiple charities supporting the wildlife and LGBTQ+ youth development. We want humans to believe that from the moment they were born, they are already a pure embodiment of art and light.</p>
      <p>For the execution of our Marketing Campaign we used Instagram.&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign that we worked uses user-generated content because&nbsp; it is the best way to boost a campaign's trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>Throughout our marketing campaign we learned a plethora of interesting insights from the interviews and research we conducted. We learned that in order to promote your brand successfully there must be not only active engagement from the side of the customer but also the team behind the creation of the brand needs to be engaged in it as well. Our team learned to listen to the customers, look for ways to maximize the opportunities and connect with people. It is not only listening but actively analysing the response from the target audience and putting the work to execute the creative vision.</p>
	  <p>In the beginning of our campaign, we set a goal to reach as many people to look at our content as we can through our Instagram account. We found out that the steady and perseverant work we put into it bared fruits. We reached an estimated 177 followers with around 45-50 likes per post, each of which had around 3-5 comments and shares. On the video content we posted we reached around 3.260 views, which exceeded our expectations. People replied to our Instagram stories and engaged with our intriguing questions and our campaign #WhatTheGender where they shared their frustrations with things in life that shouldn’t have gender specifications. Relating to the goals that we have set; our team was more than happy with the results. What did not work was mainly the direct marketing we decided to do in the beginning, we understood that sometimes people did not want to be bothered, therefore it did not go as planned and we decided to remove it. </p>
	  <p>Looking back at our executed marketing campaign, we definitely would have done a few things differently. As a team, we could have worked more thoroughly on creating content and not focusing on followers only. Moreover, we believe that a better communication could have been achieved with the number of followers that we have on Instagram. We could have posted a bit more questions and story polls to engage the viewers, but we missed that opportunity.  </p>
		<p>In light of the above, this marketing journey in brand development taught us how to execute our creative ideas combined with the marketing mix of the communication and media plan. It is a beneficial learning milestone in the process of developing a brand from scratch.  </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>Throughout the brand development course, we have executed a steady stream of information related to the marketing, production, management part of the project scope.</p>
      <p>Throughout we learned many important lessons which will be implemented in the future if we get a chance to work at a marketing company that focuses on brand development. In the case of this project continuing, we would set a goal system for each week where we would strive to complete our tasks. Moreover, our team would try to conduct more research and enlarge our target audience in order for our brand to boost its popularity. Our team will take their time to improve the website as well as create original and personalised for the brand creative content. With time, our brand message and values might change according to the marketing trends of the 21st century. Our marketing persona would eventually evolve in order to keep up with the modern-day youth trends.</p>
      <p>Our main goal will be always to please the customer, which is why we will focus on constantly evolving as a brand and being original in our approach to the buyer. More importantly, our products will be upgraded with new designs, a new set of collections will emerge and eventually our market will grow to produce not only perfumes but even jewellery or skincare.</p>
